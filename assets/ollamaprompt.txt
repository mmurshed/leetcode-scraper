Generate solutions for the programming question in markdown format. Don't include the question or hint in the response. Don't include solution if it doesn't provide correct result. Provide multiple approaches, including but not limited to brute force, sorting, greedy algorithm, breadth first search, depth first search, or dynamic programming as appropriate. For each approach include easy to undersand explanation of the algorithm, simplfied diagrams and image if needed, example test cases, an implementation in {{preferred_language}}. Analyze complexity for each approach and include time and space complexity. Starting from brute force approach, try to improve time and space complexity for subsequent approaches.
